    </main>
    <div id="about_page_content">
      <p>It's estimated that almost <strong>3.5 billion</strong> people around the world play video games of some form. With the extensive range of games and platforms we have today, it's no wonder that <strong>just under half the worlds entire population</strong> find themselves part of this group.</p>
      <p>Along with the progression in games, scores and achievements have also evolved from being the top ten listed scores on an arcade machine leaderboard. While more and more platforms are embracing crossplay, at Project Cheevo, <strong>we believe it's time for achievements and tracking to evolve as well.</strong></p>
      <p>Many of us fall into the brand loyalty mindset, and that's reinforced when our progression is <strong>limited to one platform</strong>. For those of us that enjoy completion and achievement hunting, often these feats feel worthless outside of our primary platform.</p>
      <p>We've made it our mission to ensure that whatever platform you decide to play your games on, you get the most enjoyment out of your progression, and <strong>Project Cheevo exists to fuel that enjoyment.</strong></p>
